# JWT Authentication and API Development with Swagger Documentation

JWT Authentication and API Endpoint Development with Swagger Documentation

## Introduction

This project implements user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) along with API endpoints for data retrieval. The endpoints are documented using Swagger for better understanding and usability.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implemented endpoints for user registration, login, and logout with JWT authentication.
- **Data Retrieval API**: Created API endpoints to fetch data from a public API with filtering options based on categories and result limits.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Documented all API endpoints using Swagger JS with interactive Swagger UI for testing and exploration.
- **Secure API Endpoint**: Restricted access to certain endpoints to authenticated users only.
